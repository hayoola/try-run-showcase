# A tryRun showcase with Create React App

This project was based on the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) script to demonstrate the usage of the `tryRun` function for an alternative error-handling way.

After cloning, do `npm install` to get prepared for run.



## Spec via test

In the project directory, you can run `npm test` to fire the `tryRun` unit tests. (You man need to do a `npm test a` to force running all tests, since Jest by default run tests that has been written after the last commit)
Unit tests are in the `src/try-run.test.js` file, which is the best place to learn about different use cases of the `tryRun` function.



Note: The `try-run.js` dose nothing to do with react. I just chose that for its convenient `Jest` setup!
